# Load and Reduce TSWT `*.csv` Files Into Matlab

This code was developed specifically for the `*.csv` format data files generated by the TSWT control system. The Matlab code in this project includes
- `nm_loadTR.m` to load the `*.csv` format files.
- `nm_plotTunnelRun.m` to generate a plot of the tunnel run.
